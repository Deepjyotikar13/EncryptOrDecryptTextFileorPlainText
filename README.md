Using this code, you can encrypt or decrypt plain text by directly providing it to the function. Additionally, you can encrypt any text file. The code consists of three functions. The first function creates a key, which is a dictionary used for encrypting or decrypting text or files. Each letter, number, or special character used in the text is assigned a list of two random characters. This means that each character in the message can be replaced with two random characters, making it difficult to detect patterns. Furthermore, you can increase the number of characters assigned to each letter, which enhances security.
